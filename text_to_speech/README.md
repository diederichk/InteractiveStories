In order to use this software, you will need to make sure you have Python 2.7+/3.3+, and have downloaded all of the dependencies using pip. You will also need to make sure you have the AWS CLI configured (i.e. you will need to have your secret key configured so you can access the Amazon Polly service).

## Terminal Command:

Make sure you are in the directory and type:

`python server.py`

and follow the path it outputs (for me, it was localhost:8000/index.html).

## Future notes:
* Add some preconfigured responses. As of right now, it only takes a text as input with a submit button
